# clacc
Deep Learning Accelerator (Convolution Neural Networks)

This is an implementation of MIT Eyeriss-like deep learning accelerator in Verilog

Note: clacc stands for **convolutional layer accelerator**

## Background

This is originally a course project of Deep Learning Hardware Accelerator Design at National Tsing Hua University, lectured by Prof. [Youn-Long Lin](http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~ylin/). The course is an equivalent of [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu) from stanford.

## Architecture Overview


## Usage

### Functional Simulation

### RTL Synthesis
